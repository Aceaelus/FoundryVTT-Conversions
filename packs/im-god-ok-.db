Foolhardy wizards and mystics would push themselves further and further into the astral sea, and would eventually find themselves wrapped in the eldritch mists. Lost and without guide, they would inevitably succumb to the mist's soul-draining effects, and would become little more than food for the astral beings who slept in the mists.<br />Such was the fate of one such explorer: Faye Diamond, a scholar of the otherworldly from another time and another place. Lost in the mists, she assumed that her fate would be the same as those who had come before, and indeed it would have had she not made contact with The Master of the Mists. Though their astral connection, the Master taught her all that he could about how to navigate and control the mists, and though this intervention Faye was saved.<br />Decades later, a much different woman returned to the mists which once threatened to consume her. Faye had become so attuned with the Dead Mists that they were now a part of her, and she a part of them. Fearing that she would finally be destroyed by the mists, she searched for her old master. Upon discovering his resting place and seeing his lifeless form on an eldritch golden throne, she immediately understood her final purpose: she would become the Maiden of the Mists, and would guide others the way her master had guided her years before.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"20\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Expanded Spell List</span></span>\n<p>The Dead Mists of R'lyeh have bestowed upon you an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.
